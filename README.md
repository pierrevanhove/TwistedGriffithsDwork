[Algorithms for minimal Picard-Fuchs operators of Feynman integrals in general dimensions](XXX)
==================================================================
by Leonardo de la Cruz and Pierre Vanhove

* The Picard-Fuchs operators for the [Sunset
  integrals](EpsilonDependence/): up to 20 loop order for the all equal
mass configuration, and the generic mass case for the two-loop and
three-loop sunset integrals.
* The Picard-Fuchs operators for the two-loop (one scoop) ice-cream cone
